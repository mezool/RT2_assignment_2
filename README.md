# RT2 Second Assignment
This repository contains the jupyter notebook of the second assignment for Research Track 2 course.

# What I did
I made the jupyter notebook which ......
- is an interface to assign (or cancel) goals to the robot
- plots the robot's position and targets' position in the environment
- plots for the number of reached/ not-reached targets

# How to run
To start Rviz, Gazebo and Action Service Node, please start the launch file with the following code. 
```bash
roslaunch assignment_2_2023 assignment1.launch
```
And run the codes of the notebook from above.

After that, you can send the target's position by "Send goal" button. You can adjust the value by using both slider and text. 

You can also cancel the target by pushing "Cancel" button
